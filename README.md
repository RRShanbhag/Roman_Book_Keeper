ROMAN BOOK KEEPER STORY
I want to be able to add and subtract two numbers together so that I can do my work faster with fewer mathematical errors.
So, a calculator was created which allowed the addition and subtraction of Roman numerals.

ENVIRONMENT FOR THE PROJECT
1. Ubuntu Linux
2. C programming Langauge
3. GNU GCC compiler tool chain
4. GNU Autoconf and AutoMake 
5. Check Unit Testing Framework ( https://libcheck.github.io/check/ )
6. Test Driven Development
7. Git

ROMAN NUMERAL RULES
1. Roman numerals consist of the following letters: 
   I, V, X, L, C, D, and M which mean one, five, ten, fifty, hundred, five hundred and one thousand respectively.
2. If the numeral is I, X or C you can&#39;t have more than three (&quot;II&quot; + &quot;II&quot; = &quot;IV&quot; not “IIII”).
3. If the numeral is V, L or D you can&#39;t have more than one (&quot;D&quot; + &quot;D&quot; = &quot;M&quot; not “DD”).

IMPLEMENTATION
1. Creating config.ac, Makefiles as followed Check Unit Testing Framework. 
2. Implement and tested Roman to Decimal Number conversion and viceversa starting from unit place till thousands place. 
2. Implementing Unit testing using make check with several XPASS and XFAIL test cases. 
3. Implement Error Handlers for invalid Roman Numbers.
4. Check the code working for all ROMAN Numbers from 1 to 5000.
